This directory contains run logs of gump with dense, cubic, enclosed seeds.
Seeds of this nature have no dead cells within a boundary in the shape of a
cube.  An enclosed seed is one where the live cells making up the cubic outer
boundary are all on the same plane (per side).  These seeds are formed with the
generate function, with probability set to 100 and mode set to 1.

The text files are the logs, containing two columns: <generation> <population>

population16.txt was seeded with
  seedFraction = 0.38
  habitatSize = 40
which means the seed had side length 8, or 9 planes per plane set.
This seed evolved for 23 generations.
Its end state contained 384 live cells.

population18.txt was seeded with
  seedFraction = 0.38
  habitatSize = 50
which means the seed had side length 9, or 10 planes per plane set.
This seed evolved for 71 generations.
Its end state contained 54 live cells.

population20.txt was seeded with
  seedFraction = 0.38
  habitatSize = 55
which means the seed had side length 10, or 11 planes per plane set.
This seed evolved for 65 generations.
Its end state contained 264 live cells.

population22.txt was seeded with
  seedFraction = 0.38
  habitatSize = 60
which means the seed had side length 11, or 12 planes per plane set.
This seed evolved for 4218 generations.
Its end state contained 36 live cells.

population24.txt was seeded with
  seedFraction = 0.38
  habitatSize = 65
which means the seed had side length 12, or 13 planes per plane set.
This seed evolved for 24286 generations.
Its end state contained 288 live cells.
  
population26.txt was seeded with
  seedFraction = 0.38
  habitatSize = 70
which means the seed had side length 13, or 14 planes per plane set.
This seed evolved for 169049 generations.
Its end state contained 108 live cells.
