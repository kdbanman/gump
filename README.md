# Gump
A 3D automata that seems to do neat things.

## cGump

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

A library for expressing and iterating gump environments that is much more efficient
than the Processing prototype.  The goal is to create a good serialization for a gump environment
so that seeds may be made visually in something pretty and intuitive, saved to a file, and processed
by the cGump library.

## Initial prototype

Runs on [Processing](http://processing.org/).

This was the first thing I constructed programmatically which I feel is
truly a composition of my own.  While the idea may be something I'm proud of, 
the software engineering practices are not.  This is a project that was undertaken
with very little programming experience.

### Public Abominations

My lack of experience at the time shows, so I published this as an example of some bad practices:

- Laziness-motivated global variables
- Little and/or meaningless commenting
- Unnecessary abstraction in places, not enough in others
- Inconsisent variable naming

Additionally, I do like the idea that underlies it.  The automata ruleset exhibits some pretty interesting
characteristics with some experimentation.
