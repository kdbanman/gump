# Gump

A 3D automata that seems to do neat things.  Runs on [Processing](http://processing.org/).

This was the first thing I constructed programmatically which I feel is
truly a composition of my own.  While the idea may be something I'm proud of, 
the software engineering practices are not.  This is a project that was undertaken
with very little programming experience.

### On Public Abominations

My lack of experience at the time shows, so I published this as an example of some bad practices:

- Messy global variables
- Very little or meaningless commenting
- Unnecessary abstraction in places, not enough in others.
- Poor variable naming

Additionally, I do like the idea that underlies it.  The automata ruleset exhibits some pretty interesting
characteristics with some experimentation.
