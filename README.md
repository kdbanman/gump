# Gump

A 3D automata that seems to do neat things.  Runs on [Processing](http://processing.org/).

This was the first thing I ever programmed from the ground up that I feel is
truly a composition of my own.  While the idea may be something I'm proud of, 
the software engineering practices are not.  This is a project that was undertaken after almost no education in programming, and experimentation that was limited to:

- A few programs in C that were no more than a few dozen lines each
- Some experimntation with functions in Matlab
- TI-83 Basic scripts to make my calculator a vulgar machine in high school

## A Bad Example

My lack of experience at the time truly shows, so I decided to open source this as an example of all kinds of bad practices.  Here are the ones that come to mind for now:

- There is a mess of global variables
- Very little or meaningless commenting
- Unnecessary abstraction in places, not nearly enough in others.
- No consideration for efficiency 
- Poor variable naming
